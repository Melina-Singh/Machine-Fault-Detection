# **Deep Learning System for Motor Fault Classification**

## **Preprocessing**
Raw vibration signals from the MFPT dataset (26 signals: 3 Normal, 17 Bearing Fault, 3 Misalignment, 3 Rub-Impact) were resampled to 10 kHz with 10,000 samples each. To expand the dataset to 400 signals, additional samples were simulated using Normal data, achieving approximately 130 signals per class after augmentation. The signals were then converted into 224x224 spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with `nperseg=256`, standardized, and repeated to 3 channels to match the input requirements of ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0. To enhance generalization, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) was introduced at different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) (0, 10, 20 dB), yielding a final total of 390 spectrograms.

## **Model Architecture**
The hybrid model consists of:
- **ResNet-50**: Pre-trained on ImageNet, frozen up to `conv5_block2`, extracting feature maps of size (7, 7, 2048).
- **Transition Layer**: A 1x1 convolution to reduce feature dimensions to 1280 channels.
- **Upsampling**: A `Conv2DTranspose` layer expands features to (224, 224, 3).
- **EfficientNet-B0**: Processes the upsampled features, producing a feature map of (7, 7, 1280).
- **Classifier**: 
  - Global Average Pooling â†’ Batch Normalization
  - Dense(256, L2 regularization) â†’ Dropout(0.5)
  - Dense(4, Softmax activation) for classification.

## **Training Process**
- **Dataset Split**: 80% train (312), 10% validation (39), 10% test (39).
- **Augmentation**: Random rotations, shifts, zooms, shears, and flips.
- **Optimization**:
  - **Optimizer**: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
  - **Loss**: Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy
  - **Class Balancing**: Applied class weights
  - **Regularization**: Early stopping (patience = 10 epochs)
- **Hardware**: Trained on an NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU.

## **Results**
The model achieved an **accuracy of 81%** across different SNR levels. Despite dataset limitations and upsampling challenges, the hybrid ResNet-50 & EfficientNet-B0 model successfully classified motor faults with high precision and recall. Key results include:
- **Final Accuracy**: 81%
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1-score per class
- **Confusion Matrix**: Illustrates classification performance across classes
- **Inference Time**: <1 second per sample on GPU (e.g., ~0.3s)

## **Challenges & Considerations**
- **Limited Data**: MFPT only provides 26 signals, requiring heavy augmentation and synthetic data generation.
- **Upsampling Limitations**: Expanding feature maps from (7,7) to (224,224) may have caused information loss.
- **Overfitting Risks**: A deep model with limited data necessitated strong regularization techniques.

## **Conclusion & Future Work**
While the system met classification requirements, reaching 81% accuracy, further improvements could enhance generalization and robustness. Potential future enhancements include:
- **Richer Synthetic Data**: More advanced data augmentation or GAN-based synthesis.
- **Parallel Feature Extraction**: Combining ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0 in a parallel configuration.
- **Lighter Classifier**: Reducing model complexity to improve inference speed.
